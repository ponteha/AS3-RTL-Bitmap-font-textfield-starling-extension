AS3-RTL-Bitmap-font-textfield-starling-extension
================================================

Starling TextFiled class does not support Right to Left languages like Persian, Hebrew or Arabic. There are some libraries like TLFSprite or Feathers Text Renderers which will help you use adobeâ€™s new TextFlow API to manage right to left languages. They are good to get you going but they all use runtime texture creation which will cost a lot of CPU usage to generate textures out of Bitmap fonts. So that's why this project was born.
